This project has been conducted in collaboration with Erik Baričević and Alex Schmid

Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to acquire valuable hands-on experience in
PySpark. I encountered an initial challenge during the pre-processing phase that persisted throughout the coding process. The
dataset's large size resulted in a long execution time for the code. Specifically, while
implementing logistic regression, I found it particularly challenging to work with a small
subset of the data as the computed accuracy would differ between the subset and the
complete dataset. In conclusion, this project not only enhanced my practical understanding of
PySpark but also provided valuable insights into handling large datasets and the complexities
of working with subsets. I believe that, overcoming the challenges faced has further
strengthened my skills and problem-solving abilities in data analysis.
